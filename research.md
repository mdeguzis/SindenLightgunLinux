## What is needed?

Beyond starting the Sidnen lightgun service, one of a few requirements needs to be fullfilled:
* Game must support lightgun natively
* Using a universal border in desktop mode (gnome extension)
* Border enabled in an emulator or frontend
* Border enabled in Steam's GameMode (Decky Loader plugin)
