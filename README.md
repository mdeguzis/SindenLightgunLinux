# Sinden Lightgun - Linux Utilities

- [License](License.md)
- BETA - this is currently in a BETA phase. It is unclear if the 32/64 bit binaries were properly included from the [original driver files](https://www.sindenlightgun.com/drivers/).
- The files contained within have been pulled from the latest Linux beta drivers page
- Until there is more automation in place, the files in this Git repository must be manually synced with any new release from that page.

Want to test them out and [let us know](https://github.com/SindenLightgun/SindenLightgunLinux/issues/1)?

# Installation

```
cd ${HOME}
git clone https://github.com/mdeguzis/sinden-lightgun-linux
cd sinden-lightgun-linux
./setup-linux.sh
```

### Update

Update the files of your current version:

```
cd ${HOME}/SindenLightgunLinux
git pull
```

Re-run setup if there were Sinden utility changes. This should be able to be run anytime without negative affects.

```
./setup-linux.sh
```

### Change to a new version

If you are a new install, you will be on the default "mainline" branch of the repo, typically the most current. If you want to change the version of either a new install or an update to a newer version, you can grab all versions, list them, and change via:

```
cd ${HOME}/sidnen-lightgun-linux
git fetch; git branch
git branch checkout VERSION_NAME
```

## Configure / Setup

Configure Sinden Lightgun dependencies, utilities, and borders. These scripts will install/update the software as needed, but not touch an existing configuration file(s).

```
cd ${HOME}/sinden-lightgun-linux;
./setup-linux.sh;
```

The software will be installed to `${HOME}/software/sinden`

If you wish to reconfigure/recalibrate outside of setup:
```
cd ${HOME}/software/sinden
mono LightgunMono.exe steam joystick sdl
```

## Finish

You should now reboot to have EmulationStation include the Lightgun

## Emulator Setups


### MAME

Install full Mame, avoid using packages like RetroArch and Steam EmuDeck for now.  This guide assumes you know a bit

You need to do a few things, I haven't re-installed so I may have missed something but we need to do  this.  On the Mame screen where you select roms, go down to General Settings, we want to do a few things

1) Make sure Joystick input is supported
2) Remove weird joystick settings like deadzone (these make sense for joysticks but not our lightguns)
3) Disable joystick movement in the menu (this is very annoying otherwise)

1&2)
```
Advanced options->
Joystick = On
Joystick Deadzone = 0
Joystick Saturation = 1
Joystick Threshold = 0
```

## Troubleshooting

### Gun test not working

- ssh into your device
- Plug the gun in
- check for the `LightgunMono.exe.lock` Lockfile `ls /tmp/Light*`
- Is the Lockfile there? Yes -- head to discord, lets figure this out
- Is the Lockfile there? No
    - StopAll Devices `${HOME}/$HOME/.local/bin/sindenlightgun-stopall.sh`
    - Manually start P1 `${HOME}/$HOME/.local/bin/sindenlightgun-p1-start.sh`
    - Check for the lockfile `ls /tmp/Light*`
    - Still not working? -- head to discord, lets figure this out

### Gun not working in an emulator/game

- head to discord, lets figure this out

### Auto Start/Stop not working, but gun works

With the gun plugged in run

```
cat /proc/bus/input/devices
```

This should output a list of devices, including 3 entries for Sinden Gun. One of the entries should be `Name="SindenCameraE` and have a line that identifies the vendor/product/version. Those values should be

```
I: Bus=0003 Vendor=32e4 Product=9210 Version=0100
```

If they are not, the ID for your gun is different, and why the auto detect may not be working

You will need to change the values in `/etc/udev/rules.d/99-sinden-lightgun.rules` to match your gun.

*TODO* if this is an actual bug, need to add a hook to NOT swap an updated file out.
